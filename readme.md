# NEOVIM CONFIGURATION 🎩

## Dependencies 🚧
- python3 (probably)
- neovim v0.6.1
- patched fonts (see [nerdfonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) and [nonicons](https://github.com/yamatsum/nonicons))

## Install 🚀
For package management this config uses [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim), thus run `:PackerSync`.
Note that no LSP servers are installed by default, so you will have to install them on demand with `:LSPInstall`.
Treesitter stuff can be installed with `:TSInstall`

## TODO 📝
- colorscheme to be LUA
- autocommands to be LUA
- idk
